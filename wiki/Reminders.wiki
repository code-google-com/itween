#summary Rough list of Bob's To Dos

-Simplify stopChildren and countChildren (always reuse existing tools)! - Test scenario should be a hierarchy of pingPong loops!

-rotateTo needs to use transform.Rotate and differential setting like moveTo

-Make sure move methods all have look additions (target and transform)

-Investigate and implement more bezier movement path options (from script wiki?) and perhaps rename/classify current bezier as "weighted" or more proper term fitting to its behavior?
