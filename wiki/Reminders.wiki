#summary Rough list of Bob's To Dos

-shake() is deprecated; we now have shakePosition(), shakeScale(), shakeRotation()

-Possibly leverage ASDoc or JavaDoc to auto generate documentation?

-Make sure move methods all have look additions (target and transform)

-Investigate and implement more bezier movement path options (from script wiki?) and perhaps rename/classify current bezier as "weighted" or more proper term fitting to its behavior?

-Need to add additional FixedUpdate fired Rigidbody animations similar to AniMate's approach? Or is current kinematic toggle sufficient? "This is necessary if you want to animate a rigidbody that interacts with physics." "...animation has to be done in FixedUpdate and the position/rotation applied through MovePosition and MoveRotation."

-Make sure pause and resume throws a kinematic toggle if need be!!

-CREATE AN ALL ENCOMPASSING TEST BED! 

-Make sure C# usage of JS version works on iPhone!

-Note in documentation that moves default to World now

-Note in documentation that rotates default to Local now

-Build Wordpress driven support site and leverage google code for source delivery (no more tedious zip releases on support page)!
