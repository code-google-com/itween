#summary Rough list of what's new

 * Add custom texture usage for CameraFade... or maybe just expose a method for allowing you to set it?

 * Double check all documentation especially for short versions.

 * Include information for minimum and full overloads and which ones don't have them (ValueTo and ValueFrom, more?)

 * Tweak path shape construction (not using original start control point) so it's more predictable in a loop. Test on a circle shape as well. 

 * Add Cancel utilities (maybe)

 * Add Complete utilities (maybe)

 * 

 * Default easeType is now easeOutExpo so that any usage of iTween in an Update loop will work as expected (can easily be overridden as a global by changing iTween.Defaults.easeType)

 * All parameters can be sent in any case structure desired (i.e. "easeType" can be sent as "easetype" or even "EASETYPE")

 * All iTweens can now be used in Update loops
