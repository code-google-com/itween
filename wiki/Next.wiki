#summary Where I am and and what needs to be done next development session
 * Add UpdateMove, UpdateColor, UpdateRotation, etc... instead of current update methods
 * Maybe revisit ConflictCheck and test out multiple situations?
 * Add lookTarget calculation to Shake and Punch
 * Continue to add all properties to all methods (orient, look, etc...)
